Here is some pseudo code for the skull stripping algorithm described in the paper:

1. Load MRI image

2. Threshold image to separate foreground and background
   - Try global, local, and mixed thresholding
   - Select mixed thresholding for best results

3. Apply morphological operations on thresholded image
   - Perform dilation and erosion with structural element to fill gaps
   - Use disk or diamond shaped structuring element
   - Remove small noise areas 
   - Result is mask image

4. Detect edges of mask image
   - Use Canny edge detection
   - Verify mask edges match brain edges in original image

5. Identify largest connected component in mask
   - Label mask image
   - Count pixels for each label
   - Largest label area is brain region

6. Create final mask from largest component 
   - Set largest component pixels to 255, rest to 0
   - Multiply final mask with original image 
   - Result is skull stripped image

7. Save skull stripped image

So in summary:
- Threshold to separate brain/background
- Morphological operations to fill gaps in brain area
- Edge detection to verify mask matches brain outline
- Find largest connected region as brain mask
- Apply mask to original image
